The `SelfKisser` is a simple contract allowing everyone to whitelist (`kiss`) themselves on a set of supported _Chronicle Protocol_ oracles. This allows easy access during e.g. hackathons.

> **Warning**

> This contract may never be deployed to production environments!


## How to get physical?

To whitelist yourself (`msg.sender`) on an oracle, call the `ISelfKisser::selfKiss(address oracle)`.

To whitelist some other address, use `ISelfKisser::selfKiss(address oracle, address who)`.

For more info, see [docs/Management.md](./docs/Management.md).
